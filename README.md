## MIT xPro - React Week 5 - NextTech Assignment - Fetching Data

### React – Get Data

As you've seen in the course video, React allows you to fetch data from a remote source using useEffect and display it in a list on the web page. You can also add pagination to display the results in multiple pages.

Now, it's time to practice getting data from the MIT Hacker News remote data source. In the first step of this activity you'll add code that fetches the Hacker News data, as well as add new styles to the list of articles. Then, in the second step, you'll add client-side pagination to display data on multiple pages.

The starter code for this activity is provided in the ```fetchData.jsx``` file.

In the first step of this activity, your task is to implement the fetchData method inside the useDataApi component, allowing it to get data from a remote source.

The ```fetchData``` ```async``` method dispatches the following actions:

```FETCH_INIT```: This is dispatched when ```fetchData``` is called

```FETCH_SUCCESS```: This is dispatched when the ```axios``` call is successful

```FETCH_FAILURE```: This is dispatched when the ```axios``` call has failed

Note: These actions can be found in the ```dataFetchReducer``` reducer.

Make use of the bootstrap ```list-group``` and ```list-group-item``` ```className``` to style the list of articles returned by the data source. For reference, the formatting should match the following: Note: This activity does not include the search feature shown in the course video and screenshot.

Note: We are using ```useEffect``` so that our API call only runs when the component mounts (first render), and not also when the component re-renders.

Note: The ```didCancel``` boolean is for us to use in case of the component unmounts before the API call resolves (completes). We can prevent the state from being updated.

### React – Pagination

Your task in this step is to implement the ```Pagination``` component that renders a list of buttons representing the number of available pages.

The ```Pagination``` component has the following destructured props (these are already set):

```items```: This is an array containing all articles

```pageSize```: This is the desired page size representing the number of articles per page

```onPageChange```: This is the event that is triggered when a page is selected

To implement the ```Pagination component```, complete the following:

If there is one ```item``` or less, the component should ```return null```

Calculate the number of pages based on the ```pageSize``` and ```items.length``` variables

Create a variable named ```pages``` using the ```range``` function, the ```range``` function should use the data from the previous step. This should result in an array of numbers that represents the number of pages

Use the ```pages``` array to create a new array called ```list```. ```list``` should be an array of buttons. The button should have the following properties:

The ```className``` should be ```page-item```

A ```key```

A ```onClick``` event

The ```Pagination``` component should return the list of all buttons inside an unordered list ```<ul></ul>```. The unordered list should also be wrapped within a ```<nav>```tag

Note: Use the following to have access the ```<Button>``` component: ```const { Button } = ReactBootstrap```;

Hint: The pagination button items need to have the css ```className="page-item"```
